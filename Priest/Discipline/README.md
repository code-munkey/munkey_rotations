# The Benevolent Kidnapper 👼🚑
### *Discipline Priest Rotation by munkey*

Welcome to **The Benevolent Kidnapper**, the only rotation that acknowledges the fundamental truth of World of Warcraft: **Your allies are trying to kill themselves, and it is your divine duty to stop them.**

This isn't just a rotation; it's a custodial sentence for your party members.

## 🌟 Signature Feature: Yoink & Cleanse™ Technology
Why ask a DPS to move out of the fire when you can just *drag* them to safety against their will? 
*   **Auto Leap of Faith**: We monitor your party's questionable positioning choices in real-time. 
*   **Floodgate & Ara-Kara Logic**: 
    *   Standing in saws? **YOINK.**
    *   Stunned in electrified water? **YOINK.**
    *   Wandered off to Narnia during the MOMMA fight? **YOINK.**
    *   Did you just get "Nailed" in fire? **YOINK.**

We call it "repositioning." They call it "disorienting." We agree to disagree.

## 🛠️ Features & Configuration

### 🛡️ Pain Suppression: The "Who Gets to Live" Lottery
Configurable priorities for your `Pain Suppression`. 
*   **Default**: Tank & Healer (read: You).
*   **Optional**: DPS. (enable this if you're feeling generous, or if one of them is actually pumping).

### 🚀 Ultimate Penitence: The "Fine, I'll Do It Myself" Button
We don't waste the big floaty cooldown on paper cuts.
*   **Smart Triggers**: Configurable to trigger only when X number of allies drop below a critical health threshold.
*   *Result*: 3 people dying? It's flying time.

### ⚡ Power Infusion: CD Aware PI
We don't just throw PI at whoever whispers you first. This rotation tracks major cooldowns (Avatar, Combustion, Wings, etc.) and aligns your PI perfectly. 
*   *Translation:* You look like a god-tier coordinator without saying a word.

### 🪶 Angelic Feather: Cardio is for Peasants
Why walk when you can sprint?
*   **Auto-Feather**: If you're moving for more than 2 seconds (configurable), we automatically drop a feather under your feet.
*   *Result*: You are now the fastest thing in the instance.

### 😱 Psychic Scream: Mandatory Social Distancing
Too many enemies in your personal bubble?
*   **Panic Button**: If 2+ enemies are within 8 yards (or you're getting stunned), we scream at them until they leave.

### 🕸️ Spider-Man Mode (Living Silk)
Specific support for the [**Loomithar's Living Silk**](https://www.wowhead.com/item=242393/loomithars-living-silk) trinket.
*   **Smart Usage**: Can be set to hold for high burst windows or automatically fire when your team is critically low.
*   *Translation:* Min-maxing your trinkets so you don't have to.

### 🩸 Mythic+ Automation
We've hard-coded specific survival logic for:
*   **Ara-Kara**: Handling Avanoxx's shenanigans, Eye of the Swarm, and Ki'katal's grasp.
*   **Floodgate**: If there is a mechanic, we have a plan to Life Grip someone out of it.

### 🖱️ Mouseover Mastery
Full suite of mouseover support because clicking frames is so 2008.
*   **Pull with MO**: For when the tank is moving too slow. (Off by default, for your own safety).
*   **MO Penance/Flash Heal/PS**: Just point and shoot.

## 📝 How to Use

2.  Select your victims (party members).
3.  Let the bot handle the atonement spreading while you focus on judging your teammates'.
